You’ve learned about dictionaries, strings and how you can manipulate strings by joining them using different methods. However, there are other useful aspects of string manipulation such as extracting the relevant data out of a string. Write a program to print “I have attended ------ sessions!!” from the below variable dataset

Sessions_Attended = {“sessions” : “1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14”}

[hint : it’s a good idea to use the split function]

Eg. I have attended 5 sessions!!
